#Superpark example landing page
This website is created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
In this project, I have tried to do not to use any libraries or frameworks Like Bootstrap or React or etc and I have tried to write everything from scratch. I have also tried to create a fully responsive page that gives a suitable user experience in mobile phones and tablets besides the desktop version.
IMPORTANT : This is only an example website and the contents are only used for demonstrating some designing features.
