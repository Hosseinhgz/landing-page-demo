Hi Hossein

So I was prepping the test for you, Im attaching a url with a PSD and a JPG in case you donâ€™t have Photoshop or Gimp available.

The idea would be to create that page (front-page.jpg), feel free to  come up with any ideas, and add your own touch if you consider it,  (animations / gimmicks / cool stuff that you find appropriate).

This mainly is just frontend, so no need to create a WP installation for this or anything like that, for your reference this is based in https://superpark.fi/ in case you would want to pull any assets, check similar fonts or get any ideas.

Let me know when you think you could have it ready ok?  also feel free to contact if something is not clear.

After this, based on the test, we can discuss further in a next interview with a few more members of the team, to check things like culture fit, etc etc.

How does it sound? Will be waiting for your reply,

Have a nice start of the week!
